Task 1: Exploring and Verification
##################################


This task will allow you to explore the pyATS framework for network testing and automation. You will learn how to connect to network devices, collect device data, parse the raw output into structured Python data, analyze the operational state using pyATS learning functions, and compare operational states before and after network changes using pyATS diff capabilities. 

Additionally, you will get hands-on experience with the interactive pyATS shell and become familiar with useful pyATS libraries like Dq for querying structured data. By the end of this task, you will have a solid understanding of pyATS core functions and how to leverage them for network automation tasks.

The key objectives covered in this task include:

- Exploring the lab topology and pyATS testbed file
- Connecting to devices using pyATS
- Parsing show commands to structured Python data 
- Using pyATS learning functions to collect operational state
- Triggering network changes and comparing state differences with pyATS diff
- Utilizing the interactive pyATS shell
- Leveraging pyATS libraries like Dq for querying data structures
- Leveraging pyATS APIs to query data structures
