Task 4: Results XPRESSO
#######################

Testing is a critical aspect of software development and network operations. It helps ensure the reliability, performance, and functionality of applications and network devices. However, effectively communicating test results is equally important for collaboration, decision-making, and continuous improvement.

In this task, you will learn how to leverage the power of PyATS (Python Automated Test System) and the XPRESSO dashboard to streamline the testing process and present test results in a visually appealing and easily accessible manner. Specifically, you will explore the following objectives:

- Understand the advantages of using the `pyats run job` command for executing tests and explore the structure and components of a job file.
- Execute a pre-configured job file using the `pyats run job` command and view the detailed results of the executed tests in a visually appealing web browser interface.
- Learn how to open the latest test results directly without accessing the list of previous jobs.
- Connect to the XPRESSO VM using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and explore the XPRESSO dashboard, with a focus on the Jobs section.
- Execute a pre-configured job in the XPRESSO dashboard, monitor the job execution status, and view the test results in real-time.
- Introduce a network failure and observe its impact on the test results.
- Compare the results of successful and failed job runs using the XPRESSO dashboard's Compare feature, which provides a detailed test-to-test comparison.
- Explore alternative methods for comparing test results, such as using the Requests page in the XPRESSO dashboard.
