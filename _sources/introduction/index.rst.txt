This document is intended for use by attendees of the Cisco Live 2023 who are taking Automated Testing for Your Network Hands-on Lab (LTRATO-2001).

Prerequisites
=============

- Basic Python understanding.
- Basic understanding of how to view and make changes to configuration on Cisco devices through CLI.
- Have Cisco AnyConnectÂ® installed.


Learning Objectives
===================

During this lab, you will get hands-on experience with pyATS, a vendor-agnostic suite of libraries for Python.
Then, you will learn how to build your automated tests using those frameworks.
pyATS opens a wide variety of opportunities, and soon, you will see it is not hard to start using them.
During this lab, we will show you real-world examples that you can use to start implementing the automation of tests in your network. 

Upon completing this lab, you will be able to:

#. Create a pyATS testbed file.
#. Understand the main capabilities and components of the pyATS suite.
#. Write scripts that can automate testing for specific network topologies.


Throughout this lab, you will work with and learn the following features and concepts:

1.	pyATS testbed file
2.	pyATS shell
3.	Device.connect() and Device.execute() methods
4.	pyATS test script structure
5.	pyATS test cases
6.	Logging in to pyATS
7.	pyATS Parse
8.	pyATS Learn
9.	find_links method to find all the links between devices.
10.	pyATS Run
11.	pyATS job file
12.	pyATS Log Viewer
13.	XPRESSO (pyATS Web Dashboard)
14. CX Test Automation Manager (CXTM)
